#  Hotel Reservation Management System

##  Overview
This project is a **personal and cleaned version of an academic hotel reservation system**.  
It demonstrates how to design and deploy a backend-driven application for managing hotels,
rooms, reservations, and partner agencies.

The system combines **Python business logic**, a **Streamlit web interface**, and a **MySQL database**
fully containerized using **Docker**.

---

##  Features
- Hotel room management (single, double, suite)
- Reservation creation and management
- Agency-based booking logic
- Database persistence with MySQL
- Web interface built with Streamlit
- Fully containerized environment using Docker Compose

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Query Language:** SQL (DDL & DML)  
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose  

---

##  Database & SQL
The project uses a MySQL relational database with SQL scripts for schema creation and data initialization.

Implemented SQL operations include:
- `CREATE TABLE` statements for database schema
- Primary and foreign key constraints
- Relational modeling between hotels, rooms, reservations, and agencies
- SQL queries for data insertion and retrieval



Database initialization scripts are located in:

```text
mysql-docker/
